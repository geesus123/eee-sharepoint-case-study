    <h1>Redesigning the EEE SharePoint Portal</h1>
    <p>Improving navigation, search, and overall UX for NTU's Electrical & Electronic Engineering students</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>🔍 Project Overview</h2>
    <p>EEE SharePoint is the primary academic resource portal for NTU EEE students. However, students face usability challenges like poor navigation, an ineffective search function, and an overwhelming layout. This project aimed to redesign the portal to better serve its users through research-driven improvements.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Problem Statement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigation is unintuitive with multiple sub-menus</li>
      <li>The search bar yields irrelevant or no results with small errors</li>
      <li>Homepage prioritizes visuals over functionality</li>
      <li>Important links are buried or hard to find</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>📊 User Research</h2>
    <p>We conducted surveys and interviews with NTU EEE students. Key insights include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>32.8% use the portal mainly for admin documents</li>
      <li>27.1% for project/research info</li>
      <li>21.5% for course materials</li>
    </ul>
